					<h1>New Web Design</h1>
					Today we will launch the new design of the Steam Overlay Page. It will comfort the user with a cleaner look and a much better color style. 
					Additionally, several changes where made during the development process: For detailed information about the new features and changes read the paragraphs below.
					
					<h4>We will provide some features for Counterstrike: Global Offensive.</h4>
					For detection of potential hackers we will introduce a simple hacker identifier which will allow you to check all players in your game. 
					Insert the id of the player profile and it will be checked against the listed id of players who are hacking for sure.
					Please note, that no database is running in the background. You cannot add your player id to the list by yourself, you have to contact the website administrator.
					This will be changed, if this project is ported to another server.
					
					<h4>We added a few add-on descriptions for Garry's Mod.</h4>
					For the game Garry's Mod we implemented some features for enhancing the user experience of every player on "Dannos Server". 
					These improvements include detailed information pages for every add-on used in the "Dannos Server Collection". 
					Now every add-on page has a short description of the item or map, a pros and cons section, describing how good the item or map will work, 
					and a hint section, describing when and where you should use the item or play on the map.

					<h1>First appearance of the Steam Overlay Page</h1>
					Today the Steam Overlay Page will be introduced. It can be used as a custom start page for the Steam Overlay. 
					It provides links to commonly used websites like Google or Youtube. The look and feel will probably change in the future. Look forward to it.
